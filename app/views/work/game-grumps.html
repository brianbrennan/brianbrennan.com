				<p>
					Game Grumps is a popular letâ€™s play style YouTube channel with over 3 million subscribers. Though they are currently the 165th most viewed YouTube channel, they did not have a website. Since their main content is in video form, and their entire library is on YouTube, the intention of this new site was to provide an alternate avenue for fans to view their content, while still providing the core functionality of YouTube. As such, the YouTube RESTful API was used heavily to display, organize, and interact with the Game Grumps content.
